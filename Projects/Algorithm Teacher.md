This software will show many different types of algorithms and data structures, plus how they work.

How to make:
1) Implment multiple alogirhtms and data structures in functions that can be called
2) Make a UI in which you can select with algorithm to use.
	1) This will use premade data
3) Have a visualization in which you can see how the algorithm works.
	1) Variables can be shown step by step
	2) Have arrows that allows the user to go back and foward
4) Optional: Have a way for the user to input their own data.
	1) Maybe it accepts a txt file of data
