The reason for software engineering is the rise of the SOFTWARE CRISIS.
	Projects were not being done in time and were going over budget.
	There were no guidelines for the projects to follow
	Software is difficult to maintain
	Software does not do what client wants

Software is composed of three things
	Program
	Data
	Documentation

In this course, we focus on two things
	The product
		Which is the software
	The process
		Software engineering

The computer that is inside appliances like a fridge, thermostat, cars, are called **Imbedded processers / Imbedded computers.**

Programming vs Software Engineering
	Programming is often defined as a one person activity
	Software Engineering is often so large, multiple people are required for this task. Often multiple teams.

CASE Tools
	Computer-aided-software-engineering tools
	A set of tools separated by area such as requirement analysis, structure analysis, software design, code generation, etc..
	RAD
		Rapid Application Development
		A tool used to quickly build software
