Factors affecting quality of a Software System
	Complexity
		The system is so complex that no single programmer can understand it anymore
		Fixing one bug can cause another bug
	Change
		The entropy of a software system increases with each change
			Each implemented change erodes the structure of the system which makes  the next change even more expensive
		As time goes on, the cost to implement a change will be too high, and the system will then be unable to support its intended task.

What are requirements?
	What the client is requesting
		99.9% of the time, what the client is giving you is what they want
		We need the client to understand their needs, not wants

Waterfall Model
	This is a poor model, but easy to understand
	Called the linear model
		Requirements/definition ->
		System and software design ->
		Implementation and unit testing ->
		Integration and system testing ->
		Operational and maintenance -> loop back
