**Finite Automata**![[Pasted image 20230901113938.png]]

states : s0, s1, s2
Transitions: Arrow with number on top 
Start state: Arrow pointing towards circle ->0
Acccept State: Double circle

Input: finite string
Outpit: accept or rejct
Computation process: Begin at start stte, read input symboles, follow corresponding transitions, Accept if end with accept state, reject if not.

Examples: 
01101 -> Accept
State
00101 -> Reject

Machine (M_1) accepts exaclty those strings in A where 
A = {w|w contains substring 1, 1}
It accepts a set of
